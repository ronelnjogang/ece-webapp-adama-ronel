## Tasks and Self-Evaluation

### Task 1: Server-Side Rendering

I implemented feature the server-side rendering by following these steps:

1. `npm install --save next`

2. `npx create-next-app`

3. `npm run dev`


### Task 2: Client-Side Rendering

I implemented feature the client-side rendering by following these steps:

1. `npm install --save next`

2. `npx create-next-app`

3. `npm run dev`


## Deployment

This project is deployed to Vercel and is accessible at [here](https://github.com/ronelnjogang/ece-webapp-adama-ronel).

## Security and Error Management

To ensure the security of sensitive information, we Use :

1. environment variables to store sensitive information such as API keys

2. Row Level Security (RLS)

3. Server-side rendering to generate the HTML for our pages on the server

To handle errors, we use :

1. `Try-catch` blocks 

2. The `async-await` pattern

3. The `error` event handler 

## Environment Variables

We used environment variables to store sensitive information such as API keys. These variables are defined in the Vercel dashboard and are not committed to the repository.

## Course Feedback

We found the course to be very informative and helpful. Overall, we thought the structure and content were well organized and covered a wide range of topics. One thing we particularly enjoyed was the practical examples and hands-on exercises, which helped us better understand the concepts. On the other hand, one thing we think could be improved is the availability of additional resources or materials for further learning.
