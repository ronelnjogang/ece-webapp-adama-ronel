## WEB TECHNOLOGIE PROJET

<p>Our projet is in two parts:</p>

### First part : Server

### Second part : Client

## Test

To test the dynamic routing, you can use these links:
[http://localhost:3000/articles/cd](http://localhost:3000/articles/cd)<br/>
[http://localhost:3000/article/ssr](http://localhost:3000/articles/ssr)

They will lead you to a single post page


## Structure

For this work, we created 02 files containing our articles data. Those files are located at the root of our directory in the 'posts' folder

We have a js file name "[id].js" which is responsible of getting specific post informations and display them.
